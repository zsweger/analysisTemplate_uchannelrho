# analysisTemplate_uchannelrho
This is a sample analysis script for the backward (u-channel) $\rho\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ benchmark which is still in development. It is based off of the [`diffractive VM benchmark`](https://github.com/KongTu/EICreconOutputReader) developed by Kong Tu 

The analysis script is located in `src/uchannelrho.cxx`

The plotting macro is at `macros/plot_rho_physics_benchmark.C`

To run, type `runRhoReader.sh rho_10x100_uChannel_Q2of0to10_hiDiv.0001.eicrecon.tree.edm4eic.root`

Additional EICRECON simulation files are available on [`S3`](https://dtn01.sdcc.bnl.gov:9001/buckets/eictest/browse/RVBJQy9SRUNPLzI0LjAzLjEvZXBpY19jcmF0ZXJsYWtlL0VYQ0xVU0lWRS9VQ0hBTk5FTF9SSE8vMTB4MTAwLw==)
